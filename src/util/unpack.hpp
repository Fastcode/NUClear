     * @brief Executes a series of function calls from a variardic template pack.
     *
     * @details
     *  This function is to be used as a helper to expand a variardic template pack into a series of function calls.
     *  As the variardic function pack can only be expanded in the situation where they are comma seperated (and the
     *  comma is a syntactic seperator not the comma operator) the only place this can expand is within a function call,
     *  or an initializer list (which can only accept a single type).
     *  This function serves that purpose by allowing a series of function calls to be expanded as its parameters. This
     *  will execute each of them without having to recursivly evaluate the pack. e.g.
     *      @code unpack(function(T)...); @endcode
     *
     *  In the case where the return type of the functions is void, then using the comma operator will allow the
     * functions
     *  to be run because it changes the return type of the expansion (function(T), 0) to int rather then void e.g.
     *      @code unpack((function(T), 0)...); @endcode
     *
     * @param t The resulting objects from executing the functions, these are ignored
     *
     * @tparam Ts the types of the resulting objects from executing the functions, these are ignored
