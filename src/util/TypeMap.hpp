     * The simplest and fastest map format, It stores a single value and returns it when requested later.
     *
     * This map stores a single value in it's store when the set function is called, and when get is later called this
     * object will be returned.
     * This map is accessed by template parameters, because of this when the compiler compiles this map.
     * It can resolve each of the map accesses into a direct function call.
     * This allows the map to be looked up at compile time and optimized to very efficient code.
     * There are several variations of the Map provided through the MapType parameter the operation of each of these is
     * described in their individual documentation.
     *
     * @attention
     * To future me and others who look at this code.
     * You would think that you should use an atomic shared pointer rather than a mutex protected shared pointer.
     * That would make sense, then you would potentially have a lock free implementation!
     *
     * However the implementation as seen in libc++ and libstdc++ is to use a mutex protected shared pointer anyway.
     * But worse than that, it just uses a hashmap of mutexes to protect the shared pointers.
     * Specifically it looks like they just have 0xF mutexes and they hash the pointer addresses to pick one.
     * Having only a few mutexes for the entire map is a terrible idea and causes a lot of contention.
     * This is strictly worse than the already separated mutex per type that is achieved by this implementation.
     *
     * @attention
     *  Note that because this is an entirely static class, if two maps with the same MapID are used, they access the
     *  same map
