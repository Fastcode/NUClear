         * @brief
         *  This is used to specify that only one reaction in this SyncGroup can run concurrently.
         *
         * @details
         *  @code on<Trigger<T, ...>, Sync<SyncGroup>>() @endcode
         *  When a group of tasks has been synchronised, only one task from the group will execute at a given time.
         *
         *  Should another task from this group be scheduled/requested (during execution of the current task), it will
         *  be sidelined into the task queue.
         *
         *  Tasks in the queue are ordered based on their priority level, then their task id.
         *
         * @par When should I use Sync
         *  Consider a reactor with a number of a reactions which modify its state.  It would be unwise to allow the
         *  reactions to run concurrently. To avoid race conditions, it is recommended that any reactions which modify
         *  the state be synced.
         *
         * @attention
         *  When using NUClear, developers should not make use of devices like a mutex. In the case of a mutex, threads
         *  will run and then block (leading to wasted resources on a number of inactive threads).  By using Sync,
         *  NUClear will have task and thread control so that system resources can be efficiently managed.
         *
         * @par Implements
         *  Group
         *
         * @tparam SyncGroup
         *  the type/group to synchronize on.  This needs to be a declared type within the system.  It is common to
         *  simply use the reactors name (i.e; if the reactor is only syncing with one group).  Should more than one
         *  group be required, the developer can declare structs within the system, to act as a group reference.
         *  Note that the developer is not limited to the use of a struct; any declared type will work.
