         * @brief
         *  This can be used to monitor tasks/s; if the monitored task/s have not occurred within a desired timeframe,
         *  the watchdog can be serviced to trigger a specified reaction.
         *
         * @details
         *  @code on<Watchdog<WatchdogGroup, ticks, period>>() @endcode
         *  This is a useful tool for anything in the system which might stall, and needs to be kick-started.
         *
         *  The watchdog can monitor a single task, or group of tasks, over a period of time. If no activity is
         *  detected after the specified timeframe, the watchdog will be serviced.  When the watchdog is serviced, the
         *  timer re-sets.
         *
         * @par Single Reaction
         *  @code on<Watchdog<SampleReaction, 10, std::chrono::milliseconds>>() @endcode
         *  In the example above, a SampleReaction will be monitored.  If the reactions does not occur within 10
         *  milliseconds, the watchdog will be serviced.
         *
         * @par Group of Reactions
         *  @code on<Watchdog<SampleReactor, 10, std::chrono::milliseconds>>() @endcode
         *  In the example above, all reactions from the SampleReactor will be monitored.  If a task associated with the
         *  SampleReactor has not occurred for 10 milliseconds,  the watchdog will be serviced.
         *
         * @par Service the Watcdog
         *  @code  emit(std::make_unique<NUClear::message::ServiceWatchdog<SampleReaction>>()) @endcode
         *  or
         *  @code  emit(std::make_unique<NUClear::message::ServiceWatchdog<SampleReactor>>()) @endcode
         *  The watchdog will need to be serviced by a watchdog service emission. The emission must use the same
         *  template type as the watchdog.  Each time this emission occurs, the watchdog timer will be reset.
         *
         * @attention
         *  The period which is used to measure the ticks must be greater than or equal to clock::duration or the
         *  program will not compile.
         *
         * @par Implements
         *  Bind, Get
         *
         * @tparam WatchdogGroup
         *  the type/group of tasks the watchdog will track.   This needs to be a declared type within the system (be it
         *  a reactor, reaction, or other type).
         * @tparam ticks
         *  the number of ticks of a particular type to wait
         * @tparam period
         *  a type of duration (e.g. std::chrono::seconds) to measure the ticks in.  This will default to clock
         *  duration, but can accept any of the defined std::chrono durations (nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds,
         *  seconds, minutes, hours).  Note that you can also define your own unit:  See
         *  http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration
