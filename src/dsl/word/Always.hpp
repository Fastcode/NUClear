         * This is used to request any continuous reactions in the system.
         *
         * @code on<Always> @endcode
         * This request will ensure a single instance of the associated reaction is running at all times.
         * That is, as one instance is completed, a new instance of the task will spawn.
         *
         * Any reactions requested using this keyword will initialise upon system start-up and execute continually
         * until system shut-down.
         *
         * @note
         *  A task spawned from this request will execute in its own unique thread rather than the default thread pool.
         *
         * @par Infinite Loops
         *  This word should be used in place of any reactions which would contain an infinite loop. That is,
         *  <b>it is not recommended to use a while(true) loop (or equivalent) in a reaction</b>.
         *  Using this word allows the task to (cleanly) finish and restart itself, allowing the task to
         *  terminate properly when the system is shutdown.  Note that tasks which do not terminate correctly
         *  at system shutdown will cause the system to hang.
         *
         * @par Ensure Clean Shutdown
         *  If the reaction associated with this task is performing a blocking operation, developers should make the
         *  the reaction interruptable with an on<Shutdown> reaction.  This will enforce a clean shutdown in the system.
         *
         * @attention
         *  Where possible, developers should <b>avoid using this keyword</b>.  It has been provided, but should only be
         *  used when there is no other way to schedule the reaction.  If a developer is tempted to use this keyword,
         *  it is advised to review other options, such as on<IO> before resorting to this feature.
         *
