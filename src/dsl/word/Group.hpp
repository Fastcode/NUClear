         * This is used to specify that up to GroupConcurrency reactions in this GroupType can run concurrently.

         * @code on<Trigger<T, ...>, Group<GroupType, N>>() @endcode
         * When a group of tasks has been synchronised, only N task(s) from the group will execute at a given time.
         *
         * Should another task from this group be scheduled/requested (during execution of the current N task(s)), it
         * will be sidelined into the task queue.
         *
         * Tasks in the queue are ordered based on their priority level, then their task id.
         *
         * @attention
         *  When using NUClear, developers should be careful when using devices like a mutex.
         *  In the case of a mutex, threads will run and then block.
         *  This will potentially lead to wasted resources on a number of inactive threads.
         *  By using Sync, NUClear will have task and thread control so system resources can be efficiently managed.
         *
         * @par Implements
         *  Group
         *
         * @tparam GroupType        The type/group to synchronize on.
         *                          This needs to be a declared type within the system.
         *                          It is common to simply use the reactors name for a reactor with one group.
         *                          Should more than one group be required, the developer can declare structs within the
         *                          system, to act as a group reference.
         *                          Note that the developer is not limited to the use of a struct; any declared type
         *                          will work.
         * @tparam GroupConcurrency The number of tasks that should be allowed to run concurrently in this group.
         *                          It is an error to specify a group concurrency less than 1.
