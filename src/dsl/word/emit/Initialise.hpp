             * i.e. as the reactor is being installed into the powerPlant.
             * When running emissions under this scope, the message will wait until `.start()` is called on PowerPlant.

             * @attention
             *  Tasks triggered by data emitted under this scope will only execute while the system is in the
             *  initialisation phase.
             *  These tasks are the final activity which occur before the system shifts into the execution phase.
             *  Emitting with this scope while the system is in the execution phase will act as normal emits.
