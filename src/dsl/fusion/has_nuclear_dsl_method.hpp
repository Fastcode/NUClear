/**
 * This macro to create an SFINAE type to check for the existence of a NUClear DSL method in a given class.
 *
 * The macro generates a template struct that can be used to determine if a class contains a specific method.
 *
 * The macro works by attempting to instantiate a function pointer to the method in question.
 * If the method exists, the instantiation will succeed and the struct will inherit from
 * `std::true_type`. Otherwise, it will inherit from `std::false_type`.
 *
 * @note This macro assumes that the method being checked for is a template method that can be instantiated with
 * `ParsedNoOp`.
