NUClear [![CI](https://github.com/Fastcode/NUClear/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Fastcode/NUClear/actions/workflows/main.yaml)
=======

NUClear is a C++ software framework designed to aid in the development of real time modular systems.
It is built from a set of template metapgrograms that control the flow of information through the system.

It is highly extensible and provides several attachment points to develop new DSL keywords if needed.

These metaprograms reduce the cost of routing messages between modules resulting in a much faster system.

If you're starting a new project using NUClear the [NUClear Roles system](https://github.com/Fastcode/NUClearRoles) is highly recommended
